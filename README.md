<p>If you find something wrong while using this site, It would be thankful if you make a contribution in 
  <b><a href="https://github.com/veekun/pokedex">veekun/pokedex</a></b>, because all data used in this site is from there.

English version is the default version when it comes to the data veekun provided. 
Because of these reasons, I tried display data in korean as much as I can, but something may be displayed in english.
